# ☕ Coffee Sales Dashboard

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** that provides insights into coffee sales performance using clean and interactive visualizations. It enables stakeholders to monitor sales trends, evaluate product performance, and support data-driven decision-making — without using pie charts, donut charts, or map-based visuals.
